# AES.c
## Introduction
Implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in C.

## Warning
You **SHOULD NOT** use the project in any security-demanding software.
The project is just a small exercise for my purpose. It is an extremely plain implementation of AES, and the code in the project is not guaranteed to be bug-free or attack-immune (especially side-channel attacks).

(But I believe no one would use a wild piece of cryptographic code anyway, LOL)
